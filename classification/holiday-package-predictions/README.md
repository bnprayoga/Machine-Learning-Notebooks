![App Platorm](https://holidayturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/International-travel.jpg)

## Problem Given:
"Travel.Com" company wants to enable and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base. One of the ways to expand the customer base is to introduce a new offering of packages, called Wellness Tourism Package. Looking at the data of the last year, we observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages. However, the marketing cost was quite high because customers were contacted at random without looking at the available information. This time company wants to harness the available data of existing and potential customers to make the marketing expenditure more efficient.

## Goals:
We need to analyze the customers' data and information to provide recommendations to the Policy Maker and Marketing Team and also build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the newly introduced travel package.

## Business Matrix:
Matrixes used to evaluate Model impact on business are:
1. Conversion Rate
2. Customer Acquisition Cost
3. Contact Rate
